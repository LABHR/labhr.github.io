GitHub isn't the only place where OSS happens. There are other grokers that can be created to help find those who are working hard and are under-recognised. 


### Requirements

A groker should: 
 * provide a view of information not easily found via the native web interface
 * provide an input for a project name, and an output of users who have contributed
 * be simple and easy to use


### Existing

 * [octohatrack](https://github.com/LABHR/octohatrack)
  
  
  
### Potential

See [issues](https://github.com/LABHR/labhr.github.io/issues)



### Non-Code Grokers

There may be systems which have sufficiently detailed listings, but may be hard to find. It stands to reason that instead of creating applications, a sufficiently detailed documentation page may suffice for these. For example, where a specific view of information on a platform might detail contributors. 

### More

There's probably view for more systems to have implementation or documentation. To start a discussion, create an [Issue](https://github.com/LABHR/labhr.github.io/issues/new)
